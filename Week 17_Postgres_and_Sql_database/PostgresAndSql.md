__There are different types of databases :-__

1. **NoSQL databases**

+ Store data in a `schema-less` fashion. Extremely lean and fast way to store data.
+  Examples - MongoDB, Firebase, etc..

2. **Graph databases**

+ Data is stored in the form of a graph. Specially useful in cases __where `relationships` need to be stored (social networks)__
+ Examples - Ne04j

<img src = "image.png" width=500 height=260>

3. **Vector Databases**

+ Stores data in the form of vectors
+ Useful in Machine learning
+ Examples - Pinecone

<img src = "image-1.png" width=400 height=200>

4. **SQL Databases**

+ __Stores data in the form of rows__ (similar to `collection` in `mongoDB`)
+ Most full sack applications will use this
+ Examples - MySQL, Postgres, Prometheus, etc..

## **Why Not NoSQL ??**
----------


You might've used MongoDB

It's schemaless properties make it ideal to for bootstraping a project fast But as your app grows, this property makes it very easy for data to get `currupted`

:bulb:**What is Schemaless ??**

Different rows can have different `schema` (keys / types)

<img src = "image-3.png" width=400 height=200>

Notice in the above pic, user ne `balance` ki jagah `amountBalance` daal diya then also the `mongoDB` is not complaining, also in the other pic, you can see `amount` me `string` bhej diya(instead of `number`)

**Problems ->**

1. Can lead to __inconsistent database__
2. Can cause __runtime errors__
3. Is __too flexible for an app that needs strictness__

**Upsides or Advantages ->**

1. Can __move very fast__
2. Can __change schema very easily__

>:pushpin: You might think that mongoose does add strictness to the codebase because we used to define a schema there. That strictness is present at the Node.js level, not at the DB level. You can still put in erroneous data in the database that doesn't follow that schema.

## **Why SQL ??**
----------


SQL databases have a strict schema. They require you to :- (**This is also the STEPs to start using the database**)
1. Define your schema
2. Put in data that follows that schema
3. Update the schema as your app changes and perform `migrations`

So there are 4 parts when using an SQL database (not connecting it to Node.js, just running it and putting data in it)

1. Running the database.
2. Using a library that let's you connect and put data in it.
3. Creating a table and defining it's schema .
4. Run queries on the database to interact with the data (Insert/Update/Delete)

## **Creating a database**
----------


You can start a Potgres database in a few ways -
1. __Using neondb__(easiest way to get `postgres` database)
    +go to [Neon DB](https://neon.tech/) [this is decent service that lets you create a server]
    + click on `new project`
    + give the name to the project
    + finally click on `create project` 
    + after this you will come to a window where you can find the connection string for postgres (it is similar to that provided and similar to that in `mongoDb`) [Notice the "*" present in the string is where you are going to put the password]
2. __Using docker locally__
    + `docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`
    + Connection String is below
    + `postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost5432/postgres?sslmode=disable`
3. __Using docker on windows__
    + How to run postgrSQL in windows terminal(if you have docker installed).
      - first run docker gui application that help in running commands in terminal.
      - After that run it with the docker instance by the help of following command present after this
      - for the first time if the image is not downloaded use the below command
      - `docker run --name my-postgresl -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`
      - if the docker image is there, prior to use the it can simply be runned by `docker run <image name>`
      - After that,
      - use `docker exec -It my-postgresl psql -U postgres -d postgres` this command in terminal .
      - then enter the password and it will connect to localhost Postgress instance .
      - now you will be inside the postress command line that looks like `postgres-#`
      - U can check it by running `\\dt`, (the command to display all the tables.)

>:pushpin: The connection string is similar to the string we had in mongoose.

lets understand about the **url or connection string**

<img src = "image-4.png" width=600 height=50>

## **Using a library that lets you connect and put data in it**
----------


1. __psql__
`psql` is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It provides an interactive command-line interface to the PostgreSQL (or TimescaleDB) database.
With psql, you can type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.

:bulb: __How to connect to your database ?__

`psql` Comes bundled with postgresql. You don't need it for this tutorial. We will directly be communicating with the database from Node.js

>`psql -h pâ€”br0ken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech -d database_name_here -U IOOxdevs`

talking about the above url -> 

+ `-h` -> means where is this hosted ?? you can see this in the connection string generated from `neonDB` after **`@`** 

1. __pg__
`pg` is a `Nodejs` library that you can use in your backend app to store data in the Postgres DB (similar to `mongoose` ). We will be installing this
eventually in our app.

## **Creating a table and defining its `schema`**
----------


**Tables in SQL**

A single database can have multiple tables inside. Think of them as collections in `MongoDB` database.

<img src = "image-5.png" width=600 height=200>

>:pushpin: **In `mongoDB`, it is known as COLLECTIONS and in `MySQL`, it is known as TABLES**

Until now, we have a databypse that we can interact with. The next step in case of postgres is to define the `schema` of your tables.

SQL stands for `Structured query language`. It is a language in which you can describe what/how you want to put data in the database.

To create a table, the command to run is -

```javascript
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

There are few parts of this SQL statement, lets decode them one by one 

**1. CREATE TABLE users**

**`CREATE TABLE users` ->** This command initiates the creation of a new table in the database named `users`

**2. id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY**

+ **`id`** -> The __name of the first column in the users table__, typically __used as a unique identifier for each row (user)__. Similar to `_id` in mongodb

+ **`SERIAL`** -> A PostgreSQL-specific data type for __creating an auto-incrementing integer.__ _Every time a new row is inserted, this value automatically increments, ensuring each user has a unique id_ .

+ __`PRIMARY KEY`__ : This constraint specifies that the __id column is the primary key for the table, meaning it uniquely identifies each row.__ _Values in this column must be unique and not null._

**3. email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL**

+ __`email`__ -> The name of the second column, intended to store the user's username.

+ __`VARCHAR(50)`__ -> A variable character string data type that can __store up to 50 characters.__ It's used here to _limit the length of the username._
+ __`UNIQUE`__ : This constraint ensures that __all values in the `username` column are unique across the table.__ _No two users can have the same username._
+ __`NOT NULL`__ : This constraint __prevents null values from being inserted into the `username` column.__ _Every row must have a username value._
  
**4. password VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL**

same as above, can be non unique

**5. created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP**

+ __`created_at`__ -> The name of the fifth column, intended to __store the timestamp when the user was created.__

+ __`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`__ -> This data type __stores both a timestamp and a time zone,__ allowing for the precise tracking of when an event occurred,
regardless of the user's or server's time zone.
+ __`DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`__ -> This default value __automatically sets the created_at column to the date and time at which the row is inserted into the table, using the current timestamp of the database server.__

If you have made the database then try running the above code for creating the table and updating it  

## **Interacting with the database**
----------


There are 4 thing you'd like to do with database 

### **CREATE**

```javascript
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('username_here', 'user@example.com', 'user_password');
```

> :pushpin: Notice how you didnt have to specify the `id` because it auto increments

### **UPDATE**

```javascript
UPDATE users
SET password = "new_password"
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```
You can add more complexity to the above case 

```javascript
UPDATE users
SET password = 'new_password', username= '123123'
WHERE email 'harkirat@gmail.com' AND username= ' harkirat' ;
```
The above SQL query will first check the user which has username = 'harkirat' and email = 'harkirat@gmail.com' and then it will update its corresponding password to be 'new_password' and it username to be '123123' from 'harkirat'

### **DELETE**

```javascript
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

### **SELECT**

**used to show the column from the table**

```javascript
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE id = 1;
```
__`*` will print all the column present in the table__

if you want specific column to be selected and shown then 

```javascript
SELECT username, email FROM users;
```
this will show all the `username`, `email` present in the `users` table.

## **How to do queries from a Node.js app ??**
----------


In the end, postgres exposes a protocol that someone needs to talk to be able to send these commands (update, delete) to the database.

`psql` is one such library that takes commands from your terminal and sends it over to the database.

To do the same in a Node.js , you can use one of many `Postgres clients` similar in `mongoDB`. for example -> `mongoose` is one of `mongoDB` client 

**pg library**(one of the postgres client)

[pg library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)

Non - blocking(thread is not blocked for the process like `async`, `await` and others...) postgresSQL client for Node.js 

Documentation -> https://node-postgres.com/

to use `pg`, after initialising the `node` project with `typescript` enabled write the below command (you know how to do this)

```javascript
npm install pg
```
if using `typescript` then 

```javascript
npm install pg @types/pg
```

connecting to the postgres db

```javascript
import { Client } from 'pg'

// as Client is CLASS so to use it first make the instance of the class 

const pgClient = new Client("connection_string_to_connect_your_postgres_db") // Either you do this OR 
const client = new Client({
    host: 'my.database-server.com', // present in your connection string, anything after '@' is a part of the host 
    bort: 5334,
    database: 'database-name',
    user: 'databaseâ€”user', // present in your connection string
    password: 'secretpassword!!', // present in your connection string
    ssl : true // use this only when inside the connection string, sslmode = require written  
})
// As Client can take any of the 2 arguments (one is the connection STRING and second is providing all the data in OBJECT form and then connect to the database)

pgClient.connect() // REMEMBER this is asynchronus function as this is the code to connect to the string (SO IT WILL TAKE TIME) // wrap inside the async function 

async function main() {
    await pgClient.connect()   
}
```

for example :-

```javascript
import {Client} from "pg"

const pgClient = new Client ("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

// if above is the connection string then its corresponding OBJECT type will be 

const pgClient = new Client({
    user : "neondb_owner",
    password : "wrWG5KI1ziYB",
    port : 5432,
    host : "ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech",
    database : "neondb"
    ssl : true // as our connection string consists of sslmode = require
})
// all of the value has been or can be extracted from the connection string only except port value 
```

**Now QUERYING part**

### **about `client.query`**
----------


-> whatever the command or sql query you used to give it to any sql database, that query can **be inserted into this function inside '' or "" and then this will execute the command written inside it** [do all the CRUD operations like this]

```javascript
const result = await client.query('SELECT * FROM USERS;')
console.log(result)
```

:bulb:**Write a function to create a users table in your database**

```javascript
import {Client} from "pg"

const pgClient = new Client({
    connectionString : "postgresql://your connection string goes here"
})

async function createUsersTable() { // as yahan par server se len den ki baat ho rhi h so use "await" as much as possible 
    await pgClient.connect()
    const result = await pgClient.query(`
        CREATE TABLE users (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        );
    `)
    console.log(result) // Will give the table as well as whole other things 
    console.log(result.rows) // Will give all the entry present in the table 
}

createUsersTable();
```

### **Code for writing doing CRUD operation from the database**
----------

__Now how do you actually use it in your website  to store the important things in the database. A demo of it is given below:-__

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

pgClient.connect();

app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username
    const password = req.body.password 
    const email = req.body.email 

    let sqlQuery = "INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ("
        sqlQuery += username;
        sqlQuery += ",";
        sqlQuery += email;
        sqlQuery += ",";
        sqlQuery += password;
        sqlQuery += ");"

    // EITHER WRITE LIKE THE ABOVE or WRITE LIKE THE BELOW (just in one line) [BOTH will work]

    const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('${username}', '${email}', '${password}');` // 2

    const response = await pgClient.query(insertQuery)

    res.json({
        message : "You have signed up" 
    })
})

app.listen(3000)
```
> :warning: **Remember ->** always put all the variables values inside the `''` or `""` (see the `// 2` line of code) while writing the SQL Query 

Ouput of the above code ->

<img src = "image-6.png" width=320 height=200> <img src = "image-7.png" width=320 height=200>

see in the right pic, you got the message "You have signed up" and if you see to the neon db site then under the `users` table you can see the new entry data of what has been sent from the `postman` (see `15` entry of the table)

:bulb:**What are the problems here in the above code ?**

**1. Backend Crashes ->** If you send something which is against the rules defined when creating the table (like username should be unique etc..) the your **Backend crashes**
+ to fix it -> **put it inside the `TRY-CATCH` Block**

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

async function main(){
    await pgClient.connect();
}

main()

app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username
    const password = req.body.password 
    const email = req.body.email 

    try {
        const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('${username}', '${email}', '${password}');` 

        const response = await pgClient.query(insertQuery)

        res.json({
            message : "You have signed up" 
        })
    }catch(e){
        res.status(400).json({
            message : "Error while signing up"
        })
    } 
})

app.listen(3000)
```
putting it inside the `TRY-CATCH` block will solve the things but you will see that this will still give the ERROR Reason is the 2nd thing to keep in mind 

**2. SQL Injection**

### **SQL Injection**
----------


A term you have widely heard when it comes to hacking any website or steal some data from it. 

Now you will be sending all the things like `username`, `password` and `email` inside the browser and eventually it will going to some endpoint. Now this endpoint can be extracted from the developers mode and then through `postman`, you can send the request with all the credentials required (`username`, `password` and `email`). Here `SQL Injection` comes into the picture. 

User can send **ABNOXIOUS thing (or bad data) from the `postman`**

something like this :-  

<img src = "image-8.png" width=300 height=200>

so you can say that **I WILL USE `ZOD` to validate the INPUT** and their `types` (with some constraint)

BUT `ZOD` will help you in the case of `NoSQL` database, here it cannot help much as something like `SQl injection` exists here.

Now user has the capabillity to set **any password** so he can **inject `SQL` inside the password and do something which will make your website vulnerable**

<img src = "image-9.png" width=500 height=200>

User has injected a query to delete all things from the database and with the help of password 

if you try to console what is actually being queried to your server and eventually to your backend it looks something like this 

<img src = "image-10.png" width=500 height=250>

Ignore the first query it was for some other password, look at the second query which prints on console. Now go to the sql editor and paste this query you will see that 
1. users table me corresponding email, username, and password insert ho jayega and then 
2. users table se sare records DELETE ho jayega as you have written the second query in that way only 

**Can you see how much vulnerable our app or website has became ??**

Another example (More better way sirf query he h isme nothing extra characters which will lead to run the query without even getting the error)

<img src = "image-11.png" width=500 height=150>

Now you can see its totally valid (3 queries h isme) will look something like this 

<img src = "image-12.png" width=600 height=140>

Now the above statement will execute like this manner ->

+ first it will insert the given data in the users table 

+ second **it will delete all the things inside the users table**

+ third it will insert the data in the users table(and only this data now exists in the users table)

With this power, it can do anything with the database (**CRUD operations basically**) and without even getting notices (**Think how dangerous it is**)

:bulb:**How to fix this ??**

-> **Pretty easy actually, you can achieve it by just changing the way you write the query**

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

async function main(){
    await pgClient.connect();
}

main()


app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username
    const password = req.body.password 
    const email = req.body.email 

    try {
        // Instead of writing like this 
        // const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('${username}', '${email}', '${password}');`
        // WRITE LIKE THIS 
        const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3);` 
        
        // and then adding the value of 1, 2 and 3 inside the response variable like this (GIVE IT INSIDE THE ARRAY)
        const values = [username, email, password]
        const response = await pgClient.query(insertQuery, values)
        // Benefit of writing like this see // 2 

        res.json({
            message : "You have signed up" 
        })
    }catch(e){
        res.status(400).json({
            message : "Error while signing up"
        })
    } 
})

app.listen(3000)
```

**Explantion of `// 2` code**
By writing like this you have seperated the way data was going inside the sql 

`INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)` -> ye alg se pahunchega database me and value of `username, email, password` alg se pahunchega. now isse hoga kya ki values of all these 3 will be **STORED NOT APPENDED inside the original string due to which IT GET NEVER RAN**

will look something like this in the database 

<img src = "image-13.png" width=600 height=80>

Notice the sql query **got stored not executed and hence you prevented the `SQL injection`**

In this way, you can also find that someone was trying to inject the `sql` inside the database 

:bulb:**Access token and Refresh token**

-> **Problem with JWTs ->** If your jwt gets leaked then anyone can access your account, there is no way to revoke JWT. so to solve this, you can store the JST in the database and check if it has revoked

BUT it has problem too -> you are hitting the datbase too much and with every request you are checking the database that whether the JWT has been revoked or not

so **ACCESS and REFRESH token works as Middleground** -> 

+ **REFRESH token are stored inside the database while ACCESS token aren't** so the user send the request with Access token and Refresh token. If their access token is valid for now(usually it is valid for 1 hour) then you let them through and not hit the database but if the access token is not valid then you hit the database, fetch the database, use the refresh token and then again generate a new access token

:bulb:**Why this is great ?**

-> If the access token gets leaked then they only have that for an hour (after an hour, it will become invalid) and if the refresh token gets leaked then they can revoke it as they are stored inside the database.

## **Relationships and Transactions**
----------

if you know this then you can try to build [app100x](https://app.100xdevs.com) [ becomes tough as it has **Nested structure**]

if it would have been using `mongoDb` as the database then the schema would have looked similar to the below image 

<img src = "image-14.png" width=400 height=200>

> although for a **nested structure type site, its better to use the `NoSQL` database as you dont know the limit of nesting (it can be infinitely nested i.e. you can add more nesting here)**

This is similar to what we have studied in `mongoDb` relationships  

__Relationships let you store data in different tables and `relate` it with each other.__

Although you can put all the things inside one table in the `NoSQl` database (which is the advantage as well as disadvantage for it) lets understand it by taking the example of `to-do`

<img src = "image-15.png" width=380 height=180>

you can see you have inserted all the todos inside an array and that is indirectly inside a single table known as `users` table.

**Updside of this ->**

+ the schema is easier to write and read
+ sb kuch ek jagah pr h  

**Downside of this ->**

+ any user first has to go inside the `users` table to access `todos` which is not good

hence **Decomposing data(seperating them) is good thing** so you should seperate both `todos` and `users` table and then **try to relate them** something like the below 

<img src = "image-16.png" width=500 height=250>

Notice the **Relationship denoted by RED line (userId related to id)** and hence we were able to find out the user `todos` with the help of the id and **relationship which has been created**

> :pushpin:**If you are seperating tables, then you must ensure that the RELATIONSHIPS should exist among the tables created**

so **relationships in `SQl` database looks like this ->**

<img src = "image-17.png" width=600 height=200>

This is called a `relationship`, which means that the `Address` table is related to the `Users` table.

When defining the table, you need to define the `relationships`

```javascript
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE addresses(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    pincode VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE // at last you have to write the relationship
    // This means that addresses table ka jo user_id field h that REFERENCES to the id of the users table
    // ON DELETE CASCADE -> agar kbhi users table me kuch delete hua to jahan jahan uska relationship exist krta h wahan wahan pr(here addresses table) me jake v delete kr do 
    // similar to this is 
    // ON DELETE RESTRICT -> this will restrict you to delete FIRST all the relationship which exists for the main table and then only you can delete an entry in the main table
);
```

**SQL Query**

To insert the addrerss of a user ->

```javascript
INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street pincode)
VALUES (1, 'New York', 'USA', '123 Broadway St', '10001');
```

Now if you want to get the address of a user given an `id`, you can run the following query 

```javascript
SELECT city, country, street, pincode
FROM addresses
WHERE user_id = 1;
```

Lets try to define all the above things inside and call it from the `node.js`  app 

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

async function main(){
    await pgClient.connect();
}

main()


app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username
    const password = req.body.password 
    const email = req.body.email 

    const city = req.body.city
    const country = req.body.country
    const street  = req.body.street
    const pincode = req.body.pincode 


    try {
        // Making the users table and then inserting into it 
        const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id;`
        // RETURNING id means -> id of the new user which has just now been inserted will be returned by writing this line of code 
        // id which got returned from the above line, store it inside the userId 
        const userId = response.rows[0].id
           
        const values = [username, email, password]
        const response = await pgClient.query(insertQuery, values) // 2

        // Making the address table and then inserting into it
        const addressInsertQuery = `INSERT INTO addresses (city, country, street, pincode, user_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5);` 

        const addressInsertResponse = await pgClient.query(addressInsertQuery, [city, country, street, pincode, userId])
        

        res.json({
            message : "You have signed up" 
        })
    }catch(e){
        res.status(400).json({
            message : "Error while signing up"
        })
    } 
})

app.listen(3000)
```
__The above code has some issues, can you see this ??__

-> see the `// 2` line of code, lets suppose there is case that after execution of `// 2` code, server crashed or lets say database me time lg gya iske baad(next wale line ko execute krne me), in this case, `users` table to ban gya data v chla gya but `addresses` table to hold pe chla gya na.

Now for a website, this is one **of the critical issue you will often face**

A more practical scenario of this case will be `Paytm`

```javascript
app.post("/signup", async(req, res) => {
    const query1 = "UPDATE USER WHERE user_id = 1 SET balance = balance - 10" // 1
    const query1 = "UPDATE USER WHERE user_id = 2 SET balance = balance + 10" // 2 ek se kat ke dusre me jayega 
}) 
```
Now here if the above case will come then ek query to excute ho gya but dusra nhi hua (**means `// 1` execute ho gya but `// 2` nhi**), this will totally create the chaos among the users. 

This is where `Transaction` comes into the picture. 

### **Transaction in Postgres SQL**

**Whenever you have 2 or more queries which are interrelated to each other very strictly (means ek ke change hone se dusre me change hona JARURI he h), in this case YOU SHOULD WRAP the queries inside the TRANSACTION**

**Transactions in SQL**

:bulb:Good question to have at this point is what queries are run when the user signs up and sends both their information and their address in a single request.

__Do we send two SQL queries into the database? What if one of the queries (address query for example) fails? This would require `transactions` in SQL to ensure either both the user information and address goes in, or neither does__  

```javascript
BEGIN; <-- Start transaction

INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('john_doe','john_doe@example.com','securepassword123');

INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street, pincode)
VALUES (currval('users_id_seq'),'New York', 'USA', '123 Broadway St', '10001');

COMMIT; <-- End transaction
```
you have basically wrapped both the `Insert` code inside the TRANSACTION 

Applying the above concept to above `paytm` example ->

```javascript
app.post("/signup", async(req, res) => {
    const query3 = "BEGIN;"
    const query1 = "UPDATE USER WHERE user_id = 1 SET balance = balance - 10"  // 1
    const query1 = "UPDATE USER WHERE user_id = 2 SET balance = balance + 10" // 2
    const query4 = "COMMIT;" 
}) 
```
just by wrapping inside the `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` you have said that **all the queries which are present inside this block, EITHER THEY ALL WILL EXECUTE OR NONE OF THEM WILL EXECUTE (at a particular point of time). Remember `A`(Atomicity) in `ACID` property of database** 

simply saying, if `// 1` has executed and `// 2` failed, then `// 1` will **Revert back**

wrapping the above code(example of `node.js` site) inside the transaction 

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

async function main(){
    await pgClient.connect();
}

main()


app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.body.username
    const password = req.body.password 
    const email = req.body.email 

    const city = req.body.city
    const country = req.body.country
    const street  = req.body.street
    const pincode = req.body.pincode 


    try {
         
        const insertQuery = `INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id;`
        const addressInsertQuery = `INSERT INTO addresses (city, country, street, pincode, user_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5);` // 1

        // wrapped inside the transaction 
        await pgClient.query("BEGIN;")
        const values = [username, email, password]
        const response = await pgClient.query(insertQuery, values)
        const userId = response.rows[0].id // 2
        const addressInsertResponse = await pgClient.query(addressInsertQuery, [city, country, street, pincode, userId])
        await pgClient.query("COMMIT;")
        

        res.json({
            message : "You have signed up" 
        })
    }catch(e){
        res.status(400).json({
            message : "Error while signing up"
        })
    } 
})

app.listen(3000)
```

:bulb:**You can have question in your mind that if the server crashed at `// 1` line of code, then `// 2` will be able to get `id` as `RETURNING id` to execute ho gya but `// 2` to chla he nhi so in this case it tries to create the new entry and eventually fails** 

## **Joins**

----------

Lets try to solve a problem 

<img src = "image-18.png" width=500 height=200>

:bulb:given the id = 12, return me all the data(means user related info. + address related info.) related to user whose id = 12 if someone hits the backend point (`/metadata`) ??

-> how will you do the above problem 

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

async function main(){
    await pgClient.connect();
}

main()

app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    // signup logic already written above
    
})

app.get("/metadata", async(req, res) => {
    const id = req.body.id // given this id = 12 here how to get all the data 

    // const query1 = await `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1` // make sure you do not add "*" as it will return all the data (including some sensitive data such as password) so instead jitna jarurat h utna he return kro 
    const query1 = await `SELECT username, email, id  FROM users WHERE id = $1`
    const response1 = pgClient.query(query1, [id]);

    const query2 = await `SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE user_id = $1`
    const response2 = pgClient.query(query2, [id]);

    res.json({
        user : response1.rows[0]
        address : response2.rows[0] // 2
        address : response2.rows // 3
    }) 
})
app.listen(3000)
```

when you will go to link -> https://localhost:3000/metadata?id=12"

you will see the output 

<img src = "image-19.png" width=500 height=250>

You can see all the data related to user with id = 12 in the above picture 

But the above code has some error, **ideally user has more than one address, so it should be able to see all the address stored and linked to it in the database and hence you should RETURN AN ARRAY of addresses**

so instead of returning only one row, it should return **all the rows** so write `// 3` line of code instead of `// 2`. (if a new entry will come that will also now will be reflected now)

<img src = "image-20.png" width=400 height=200>

Now the output looks like this -> you have got the **ARRAY of address being returned**

:bulb:**why this approach is bad ??**

-> due to the reason that you are **sending two seperate queries**[if some change happened after the 1st query so 2nd query will not be knowing about this (later it will know but for the time being, it will not be able to know about this), and hence anomalies will occur]

**The Better version of the above approach is `JOINS`**

### **JOINS**
----------


Defining relationships is easy.

What's hard is Joining data from two (or more) tables together.

__For example,__ if I ask you to fetch me a users details and their address, what SQL would you run?

**Approach 1 -> Bad one**

```javascript
- Query 1: Fetch user's details

SELECT id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE id = YOUR_USER_ID

- Query 2 Fetch user's address
SELECT city, country, street, pincode
FROM addresses
WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID
```

**Approach 2 -> using joins**

```javascript
SELECT users.id, users.username, users.email, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
FROM users
JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id
WHERE usersid = `1`;

// OR you can write the above code like this also(just used ALIAS in this nothing extra)
SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, a.city, a.country, a.street, a.pincode
FROM users u
JOIN addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
WHERE u.id = YOUR_USER_ID
```
>:pushpin:<span style="color:orange">**Remember ->**</span> **while using `JOIN`, a new table is created.**

<img src = "image-21.png" width=600 height=200> 

<img src = "image-22.png" width=600 height=200>


so applying the above concept in solving or making the endpoint -> `/metadata`

the code looks like this ->

```javascript
import express from "express"
import { Client} from "pg";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const pgClient = new Client("postgresql://neondb_owner:wrWG5KI1ziYB@ep-lucky-snow-a50ilb0b5.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require?")

async function main(){
    await pgClient.connect();
}

main()

app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
    // signup logic already written above
    
})

app.get("/metadata", async(req, res) => {
    const id = req.query.id 
    const query = `SELECT users.id, users.username, users.email, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode FROM users JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id WHERE usersid = $1;`
    // Instead of $1 why not this -> ${id} REASON -> SQL Injection  

    const response = await pgClient.query(query, [id])
    res.json({
        response : response.rows // REMEMBER -> if you will do simply send "response" then PURA OBJECT de dega(consisting of hell lot of things (from SQL command which involved to other SQl realted entity value))
        // by writing "response.rows" -> ye bas table me jo pda h wo dega (NOTHING EXTRA)
    })
})
app.listen(3000)
```
Now the output looks like this ->

<img src = "image-23.png" width=500 height=200>

>:pushpin:<span style="color:orange">**Remember ->**</span> **`JOIN` is a expensive task to perform**[computationally tough task to perform]
>
> > lets say one table has M (lets say 10000) rows and other has N(lets say 35) rows then to join both the table **in WORST CASE would be M*N (10000 * 35)**

Other than the above demerit, it(JOIN) has mostly advantages :-

1. __Reduced Latency__
2. __Simplified Application Logic__
3. __Transactional Integrity__

### **Types of JOINS**
----------

#### **INNER JOIN**

__Returns rows when there is AT LEAST one match in both tables.__ If there is no match, the rows are not returned. It's the __most common type__ of join.

__Use Case :-__ Find All Users With Their Addresses. If a user hasn't filled their address, that user shouldn't be returned.

> :pushpin:<span style="color:orange">**Remember ->**</span> **BY DEFAULT -> `JOIN` works the same way as `INNER JOIN`**

```javascript
SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street,addresses.pincode
FROM users
INNER JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

#### **LEFT JOIN**

__Returns ALL rows from the LEFT table, and the MATCHED rows from the RIGHT table.__

**Use case :-** To __list all users from your database along with their address information__ (if they've provided it), you'd use a LEFT JOIN. Users without an
address will still appear in your query result, but the address fields will be NULL for them.

```javascript
SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street, addresses.pincode
FROM users
LEFT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

#### **RIGHT JOIN**

__Returns ALL rows from the RIGHT table, and the MATCHED rows from the LEFT table.__

__simply saying__ -> <span style="color:orange">**if there is something which is in left and not in right, then that should come as well as vice versa of this should also come and those which are present in both left and right that should also come**</span>

>:round_pushpin: **RIGHT JOIN = !(LEFT JOIN)**

**Use case :-** Given the structure of the database, a __RIGHT JOIN would be less common since the `addresses` table is unlikely to have entries not linked to a user due to the foreign key constraint.__ However, if you had a situation where you start with the `addresses` table and optionally include user information, this would be the theoretical use case.

```javascript
SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street addresses.pincode
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

#### **FULL JOIN**

**Returns rows when there is a MATCH in one of the tables. It effectively combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.**

> :round_pushpin:**FULL JOIN = RIGHT JOIN + LEFT JOIN**

**Use case :-** A FULL JOIN would __combine all records from both users and addresses showing the relationship where it exists.__ Given the constraints, this
might not be as relevant because every `address` should be linked to a `user`, but if there were somehow orphaned records on either side, this query would reveal them.

```javascript
SELECT users.username, addresses.city, addresses.country, addresses.street,  addresses.pincode
FROM users
FULL JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```
